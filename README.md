# Elemental

> A Tailwind and DaisyUI based Phoenix components library.

### Note

As it is right now this is mostly an experimental playground for myself
and intended to explore frontend patterns as a person only a passing
experience in frontend and a higher preference for backend stuff.

This as such currently mainly acts an experimental playground, in addition
to me exploring stuff on the side on my own time as well as having a
super minimal side project when I wanna play around with arbitrary
frontend components.
