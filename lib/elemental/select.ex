  > An abstraction on top of DaisyUI's (& plain HTML) select.

  This abstracts native HTML selects providing an API that is compatible
  1-1 with `Elemental.Dropdown` aiming to provide consistency between
  the main/core input components provided by Elemental.

  ## Usage

  Most basic usage is done by simply passing it `options`

      <.select options={["Foo", "Bar"]}/>

  See `select/1` for details on the support properties and their behaviour.

       The list of values to select between. This is required to either be a list of
       strings, or a list of string tuples.

       ### List item types

       - If given as a list of strings (`[String.t]`) each option will use that value
         as both it's label and value sent to from the dropdown.
       - If give as a list of tuples (`[{String.t, String.t}]`), those tuples are expected
         to be two strings, the first being the label to use, while the second is
         expected to be the value to send from the dropdown.
       - Mixing the two forms is allowed.
       - Nested lists translate to option groups. See `Phoenix.HTML.Form.options_for_select/2`.
